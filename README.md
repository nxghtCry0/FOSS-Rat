# Remote Access Trojan (RAT) ‚Äì Educational Project

> **Disclaimer**: This project is intended **strictly for educational and research purposes**. Do **not** use this software to access, monitor, or control devices without **explicit consent**. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains a proof-of-concept Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed to support research and educational development of antivirus evasion and malware detection techniques. It is open-source to promote understanding of malware behavior and to aid in the development of security defenses.

This project is being developed as part of a duo-led effort, using a Discord bot as its command-and-control (C2) interface.

## üéØ Purpose

* Educational exploration of RAT behavior
* Learning and testing antivirus detection algorithms
* Analyzing malware signatures and evasion methods
* Building knowledge in cybersecurity and ethical hacking

## Usage
- To use, it's quite simple.
- Get a bot token and configure, implant.py is built with python to exe tools using a b64 encoded token.
- You can then execute commands through the c2 controller from your bot to the targeted device.


## ‚ùó Important Notice
